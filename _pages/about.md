Hello,

I'm a Master 2 student in Mathematics and AI at the Orsay Campus of the Université Paris-Saclay. After my Master 1 research internship on deep learning for computer vision, my goal is to acquire practical and fundamental knowledge on Vision, Multimodal Models and Self Supervised Training in order to continue with a PhD in these field.

During my studies, I had the opportunity to get involved in several organizations, carry out projects and internships, and cross several mountain ranges on foot. It would be a pleasure to talk about my passions, mathematics, AI and biology. 
Please don't hesitate to contact me!

Thank you for taking the time to find out more about my background.

Kind regards,
Scalabrino Morgan
