Hello,

I'm a Master's student in Mathematics and AI at the Orsay Campus of the Universit√© Paris-Saclay. After a double bachelor in Mathematics and Biology, my goal is to acquire practical and fundamental knowledge in Deep Learning and Machine Learning in order to continue with a PhD in Deep Learning. 

During my studies, I had the opportunity to get involved in several organizations, carry out projects and internships, and cross several mountain ranges on foot. It would be a pleasure to talk about my passions, mathematics, AI and biology. 
Please don't hesitate to contact me!

Thank you for taking the time to find out more about my background.

Kind regards,
Scalabrino Morgan
